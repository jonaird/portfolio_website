// Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name's Jonathan Aird. I'm a full stack software engineer with a strong interest in Flutter and front end work. I'm from Chicago but I currently live in my wife's hometown in Hungary with our 1 year old son.

// Computers have played a huge role in my life since a very young age since my father is also a software engineer. One of my earliest memories is sitting under his desk when he had taken me to work and taking apart a printer to marvel at the different components. 

// My fascination with computers has always been about user interfaces. I loved changing the skin of WMP as a kid and as I got older I chose android phones not because I liked them more but because I could bootload different versions of android with different skins

// My passion is designing new solutions for user interface problems

// My development philosophy is very simple:

// Complexity in front end development is a completely tractable problem.

// Front end code tends to get quite complicated very quickly as apps scale. Generally this isn't because apps are being programmed with extravagant behaviors. Rather the problem is the number of responsibilities the front end code has. The front end code must define how the UI should look, deal with UI logic, application state and often business logic as well. As a result, front end code tends to be difficult to organize in a coherent, understandable way that also minimizes complex interdependencies between parts of the code base.
